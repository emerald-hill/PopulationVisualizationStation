# PopulationVisualizationStation

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize world population data both graphically and geospatially. The data is searchable to find specific countries, and countries on the map can be clicked to show more information. Our dataset comes from the World Bank's DataBank and shows data from 2013 through 2022. 

### How to use and interact with our pages
1. The "World Map" page contains an interactable world map showing the population of each country. Clicking a country shows a popup containing more data about the selected country.  
2. "Country Information" has a searchable list of each country in the dataset and shows a population history chart for each country.  
3. Information about our data sources can be found later in this README, as well as on the "Data Sources" page.  


### Ethical considerations made in this project
The dataset used in this project comes from the World Bank, affiliated with the World Bank Group (WBG). WBG is an international organization interested in financially supporting developing nations and reducing poverty globally. 189 national governments work with the World Bank, contributing to policy and spending decisions.  

The World Bank's DataBank references Census reports in addition to Eurostat and United Nations reports. The goal of this project is simply to visualize existing data, and as such we have not modified any data points.
